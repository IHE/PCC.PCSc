# Warnings_01: There has been a validator update since the underlying HL7 Clinical Document Architecture IG was published. There are a number of structured elements that were built using the [0], [=] method. Since the publication, an new 'best practices' warning comes up indicating that the format of [0] should be replaced with [+]. Until the publication is updated with these edits, this profile will maintain this warning. 
Constraint failed: eld-24: 'pattern[x] should be used rather than fixed[x]' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ElementDefinition) (Best Practice Recommendation)


# Warnings_02: ValueSet references and Aliases in Dependent CDA IG need to be updated to call on the value set version or Current version of the value set to be bound into the profiles. I cannot fix all references to errors from external sources that are pulled in via the dependency 
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-RoleClassRelationshipFormal'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.0.0, 3.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-RoleClassRelationshipFormal' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-RoleClassRelationshipFormal|3.0.0'


# Warnings_03: Validator limitations generating this error 
Unable to check if http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/Languages is a proper subset of http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/all-languages - base value set is too large to check
